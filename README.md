#ESP32 Projects
This is a place for tracking my ESP32 projects.  
My development environment is a Mac book using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.  


## Projects
**OLED display** using the Adafruit Featherwing OLED 128x32 pixel display and the ESP32-DevKit C.  
The ESP_IDF framwork used is "esp-idf-v2.0-rc1".
